#+title: The Emil Programming Language
#+author: Matt Rudary

Emil is a programming language in the ML family. Its basic syntax and
semantics are similar to Standard ML, with a few extensions thrown in.
Like Standard ML, it is a functional language with strong, static
types and type inference, it is eagerly evaluated by default, and
supports imperative programming, side effects, and exception handling.
It has parametric modules, like Standard ML, but it also supports
overloading through an implicit module feature that is similar in
effect to Haskell's type classes.
