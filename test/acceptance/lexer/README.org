These are acceptance tests for Emil lexers. For each test there is an
input file and a corresponding output file. The input file contains a
number of tokens. The output is expected to contain one line per
well-formed token, with some modifications described below.

The line for a well-formed token should start with a 0-padded 4-digit
line number that the token started on, a space, the token type, a
space, an additional field that depends on the token, another space,
and the text of the token, followed by a newline. Spaces are omitted
when the auxiliary or token text are empty.

| Token type | Auxiliary field                                      |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| CHAR       | 0-padded 6-digit hex codepoint                       |
| STRING     | 0-padded 2-digit hex codepoint per byte of string    |
| ILITERAL   | Decimal repr, with 'i' suffix when number is an int. |
| FPLITERAL  | printf format %.13e                                  |

Hex-formatted numbers should use uppercase letters.

An ill-formed token should have a line that starts with a 0-padded
4-digit line number, followed by a space and the word "ERROR",
followed by a newline. After an ill-formed token is detected, the
lexer should advance past the next instance of the text "(*xx*)" and
continue scanning the input.
